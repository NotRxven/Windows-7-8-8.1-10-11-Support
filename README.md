## Common Issues & Fixes

### **1. Windows Update Errors**

**Issue**: Windows updates sometimes fail to install or get stuck, showing error codes like 0x80070020 or 0x8024a105.

   - Go to **Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters**.
   - Select **Windows Update** and run the troubleshooter.
   
2. **Clear the Windows Update Cache**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type:
     ```bash
     net stop wuauserv
     net stop bits
     ```
   - Delete the contents of `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution`.
   - Restart the Windows Update service:
     ```bash
     net start wuauserv
     net start bits
     ```

3. **Manually Install Updates**:
   - If the issue persists, visit the **Microsoft Update Catalog** (https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/) to download and install the updates manually.

4. **Check for System Corruption**:

### **2. Driver Conflicts**

     - Right-click the device in **Device Manager**.
     - Select **Uninstall device** and then restart your computer to reinstall the driver.

3. **Roll Back Drivers**:
   - If a recent driver update is causing issues, you can roll back to a previous version:
     - In **Device Manager**, right-click the device, choose **Properties**, and go to the **Driver** tab.
     - Click **Roll Back Driver** if the option is available.

4. **Use Driver Updater Tools**:
   - Third-party driver management tools (like **Driver Booster** or **Snappy Driver Installer**) can help you identify and update missing or outdated drivers.
